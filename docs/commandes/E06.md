 Field type (enter ? to see all types) [string]:

 What class should this entity be related to?:
 > Type

What type of relationship is this?
 ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Type         Description                                                      
 ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
  ManyToOne    Each Movie relates to (has) one Type.                            
               Each Type can relate to (can have) many Movie objects            
                                                                                
  OneToMany    Each Movie can relate to (can have) many Type objects.           
               Each Type relates to (has) one Movie                             
                                                                                
  ManyToMany   Each Movie can relate to (can have) many Type objects.           
               Each Type can also relate to (can also have) many Movie objects  
                                                                                
  OneToOne     Each Movie relates to (has) exactly one Type.                    
               Each Type also relates to (has) exactly one Movie.               
 ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------- 

 Relation type? [ManyToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany, OneToOne]:
 > ManyToOne

 Is the Movie.type property allowed to be null (nullable)? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > no

 Do you want to add a new property to Type so that you can access/update Movie objects from it - e.g. $type->getMovies()? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > yes

 A new property will also be added to the Type class so that you can access the related Movie objects from it.

 New field name inside Type [movies]:
 > 

 Do you want to activate orphanRemoval on your relationship?
 A Movie is "orphaned" when it is removed from its related Type.
 e.g. $type->removeMovie($movie)
 
 NOTE: If a Movie may *change* from one Type to another, answer "no".

 Do you want to automatically delete orphaned App\Entity\Movie objects (orphanRemoval)? (yes/no) [no]:
 > 

 updated: src/Entity/Movie.php
 updated: src/Entity/Type.php
